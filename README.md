## Introduction

This app was created in the last project week of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

WDI-13

## Vision

I had a few ideas of what I wanted to do for my final project but decided on an AirBnB type website. Seeing as I had come from a background in Travel & Tourism, I thought this would fit quite well. I wanted the website to be about the fact that traveling can be fun and cheap. What I wanted to implement was a karma/feedback system and chore system. For example, a user would be able to search for listings on various places to stay around the world. A user could also become a host and put their place up for other users to stay at. They could also list a number of "chores" that they would need done in exchange for a length of stay.

## Frameworks, API's & Gems

I built this application using the following frameworks and gems:
* Ruby 2.3.0
* Rails 4.2.6
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Devise
* Toastr-rails
* Omniauth
* Omniauth-facebook
* Omniauth-google-oauth2
* Omniauth-github
* Font-awesome-rails
* Carrierwave
* Cloudinary
* Geocoder
* Jquery-ui-rails
* Ransack
* Google Maps API

## Models

There are 7 models I used:

* Users
* Rooms
* Reviews
* Reservations
* Photos
* Messages
* Conversations

## Functionality

The application is designed to allow authenticated users to create, edit and view their own:

* **Room Listings** (can create a room listing based on geo location with various options such as entire, private or shared apartments and housing)
* **Messages and Conversations** (can send messages back and forward between each user)
* **Reviews** (who can create reviews based on the properties they stay at)

## Bugs & defects
